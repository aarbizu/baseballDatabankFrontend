### TODO

- ~~player name search (last name substring)~~
- (WIP) use the ktor param parsing to handle form submits, etc
- add linking from bbrefid to the bbref site
- add the ability to query player name by regex (first, last, full name)
- process the db to build some static content pages
    - players (reg/postseason)
    - teams (reg/postseason)
    - managers (reg/postseason)
- checkbox modifiers to superlative queries, e.g. top HR hitters whose names are:
    - palindromes
    - supervocalic
